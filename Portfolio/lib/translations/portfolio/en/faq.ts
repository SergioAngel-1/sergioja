  'faq.general.q2': 'What is your main tech stack?',
  'faq.general.a2': 'Frontend: React, Next.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS. Backend: Node.js, NestJS, Laravel, Symfony, Express. Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB. DevOps: Docker, CI/CD, AWS, Vercel. I also work with automation tools, RPA, and AI integration.',
  
  'faq.general.q3': 'Do you work remotely?',
  'faq.general.a3': 'Yes, I work 100% remotely from Colombia. I have experience collaborating with globally distributed teams and adapt to different time zones according to project needs.',
  
  'faq.general.q4': 'Do you offer technical consulting services?',
  'faq.general.a4': 'Absolutely. I offer consulting in software architecture, code audits, performance optimization, technology strategy, and stack selection. I can help you make informed technical decisions for your project or company.',
  
  // Services Questions
  'faq.services.q1': 'Do you develop mobile applications?',
  'faq.services.a1': 'I primarily focus on Progressive Web Apps (PWA) that work perfectly on mobile devices. For native applications, I can work with React Native or recommend trusted specialists based on specific requirements.',
  
  'faq.services.q2': 'Do you offer post-launch maintenance and support?',
  'faq.services.a2': 'Yes, I offer maintenance plans that include security updates, bug fixes, performance optimizations, new features, and ongoing technical support. Terms are defined according to each project\'s needs.',
  
  'faq.services.q3': 'Can you integrate existing systems with new solutions?',
  'faq.services.a3': 'Definitely. I have extensive experience in complex integrations: REST/GraphQL APIs, webhooks, third-party services (Stripe, PayPal, AWS, etc.), legacy systems, and workflow automation between platforms.',
  
  'faq.services.q4': 'Do you work with design teams or need complete designs?',
  'faq.services.a4': 'I can work with both scenarios. If you have a design team, I collaborate closely with them to implement the exact vision. If not, I can create functional and modern interfaces based on UX/UI best practices or recommend specialized designers.',
  
  // Process Questions
  'faq.process.q1': 'What is your development process?',
  'faq.process.a1': 'I follow an adapted agile methodology: 1) Discovery and requirements analysis, 2) Architecture design and planning, 3) Iterative development with frequent deliveries, 4) Continuous testing and QA, 5) Deployment and monitoring, 6) Post-launch support. I maintain constant and transparent communication throughout the process.',
  
  'faq.process.q2': 'How often will I receive project updates?',
  'faq.process.a2': 'I provide detailed weekly updates and am available for follow-up meetings as agreed. I use project management tools (Jira, Trello, Notion) so you can see progress in real-time.',
  
  'faq.process.q3': 'What do you need from me to start a project?',
  'faq.process.a3': 'I need a clear description of project objectives, target audience, main functionalities, visual references (if any), expected timelines, and approximate budget. Then we schedule a discovery meeting to dive into technical details.',
  
  'faq.process.q4': 'Do you deliver source code and documentation?',
  'faq.process.a4': 'Yes, always. Deliverables include: complete source code, technical documentation, deployment guides, access credentials, and full intellectual property transfer. Everything is in your hands upon project completion.',
  
  // Technical Questions
  'faq.technical.q1': 'How do you ensure application security?',
  'faq.technical.a1': 'I implement security best practices: robust authentication (JWT, OAuth), sensitive data encryption, input validation, protection against common attacks (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection), dependency audits, and secure server configuration.',
  
  'faq.technical.q2': 'Are the applications you develop scalable?',
  'faq.technical.a2': 'Absolutely. I design architectures built to grow: modular code, optimized databases, strategic caching, load balancing, microservices when necessary, and performance monitoring. Your applications will be ready to handle exponential growth.',
  
  'faq.technical.q3': 'Do you implement SEO and performance optimization?',
  'faq.technical.a3': 'Yes, it\'s a fundamental part of my work. I implement SSR/SSG with Next.js, image optimization, lazy loading, code splitting, Core Web Vitals, structured meta tags, sitemaps, schema markup, and all modern technical SEO techniques.',

  'faq.pricing.q3': 'Do you require upfront payment?',
  'faq.pricing.a3': 'Yes, I work with a milestone payment model: 30-40% upfront, intermediate payments based on agreed deliverables, and final payment upon project completion. This protects both parties and keeps the project moving forward consistently.',
  
  'faq.pricing.q4': 'Do you offer discounts for startups or NGOs?',
